### What I learned

Upon completing this challenge, I was able to understand CSS positioning better and also the use of margins and paddings to style any part of a webpage.
I was also able to learn the shorthand way of specifying our margins and paddings.


### Continued development

 Completing this challenge has made me realize the importance of typography in web design and development and how it can useful in passing the intended message without interpreting it something else through the wrong use of common properties such as font, Colors and other elements or properties that could affect the user interface.
 If I study typography more closely, I would be better at creating better websites to get great user experience from the user.
